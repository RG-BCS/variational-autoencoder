# VAE Projects Collection

This repository serves as the main hub for a collection of VAE-based projects. Each sub-repository focuses on a
different application of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), including face morphing, anomaly detection, and
reconstruction performance comparisons.

## Sub-Repositories 

### 1. [face-morph-vae]
- **Description:** Face morphing using a Variational Autoencoder combined with UTFK dataset.
- **Features:**
  - Latent space interpolation between faces
  - Uses UTFK for higher quality morphing
- **Goal:** Generate smooth transitions between different facial identities.

---

### 2. [vae-anomaly-mnist]
- **Description:** Anomaly detection in the MNIST dataset using VAEs.
- **Features:**
  - Trains a VAE on MNIST digits
  - Detects a digit that doesnâ€™t conform to training distribution
- **Goal:** Learn normal patterns and flag anomalies.

### 3. [fashion-mnist-vae-VS-ae-demo]
- **Description:** Compare VAE and Autoencoder (AE) performance on Fashion MNIST.
- **Features:**
  - Trains both VAE and AE models
  - Visual comparison of reconstruction quality
- **Goal:** Highlight differences between VAEs and standard AEs.
